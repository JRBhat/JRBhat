## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me  

- üî¨ **Background**: I started as an R&D Project Scientist specializing in clinical trials for skincare and cosmetic products, but slowly transitioned my expertise into coding and AI/ML applications to solve real-world challenges in healthcare.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **What I Do**:  
  - Develop Python-based tools for data processing, image analysis, and automation.  
  - Build AI/ML solutions for healthcare imaging and clinical workflows.  
  - Automate repetitive tasks using scripting and workflow orchestration tools.  
- üöÄ **Currently Exploring**: Computer vision, deep learning, and advanced process automation.  
- üéØ **Goal**: All the interesting projects you find here wouldn't have been successful without the support, tips and mentorship of people way smarter than me from other diverse backgrounds. I feel both lucky and grateful for having had the chance to collaborate with them. That's why I want to stay open for future collaboration on impactful AI/ML/Software projects, especially in healthcare, automation and imaging. Feel free to reach out. Cheers!
